This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on loan approval classification. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not.

Introduction: In this project, we use a dataset of loan application information to train and evaluate several machine learning models for loan approval classification. The dataset includes various features such as applicant's income, credit history, education level, and more. The main focus is to predict the target variable "Loan_Status," which indicates whether the loan was approved or not.
