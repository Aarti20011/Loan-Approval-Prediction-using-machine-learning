 Today, I'm excited to introduce you to my Loan Approval Classification Model.and resources for a machine learning project focused on loan approval classification.

      This repository contains code I'm thrilled to share my latest data science endeavor with you! I've been hard at work on a project that dives deep into the world of machine learning and real-world data.The goal of this project is to build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not.

Introduction: In this project, we use a dataset of loan application information to train and evaluate several machine learning models for loan approval classification. The dataset includes various features such as applicant's income, credit history, education level, and more. The main focus is to predict the target variable "Loan_Status," which indicates whether the loan was approved or not.
